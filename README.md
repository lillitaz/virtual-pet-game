## Study Project

"Virtual Pet" game: in this game, the player will have a virtual pet that they need to take care of. 
The virtual pet could be a cat, dog, fish, or any other animal of their choice.

The player will need to feed their pet, give them water, take them for walks, play with them, and keep them healthy. The game could also have mini-games like hide-and-seek, fetch, and other activities to keep the pet entertained.

To create this game, I will use Java graphics to create the virtual pet and its environment. Libraries: LWJGL
